# Userscripts

These are userscripts to be used in conjuction with a userscript extension. My recommendations are below.  
Note: Chromium includes nearly any browser besides Firefox based browsers and Safari. Chrome, Edge, Opera, Brave, and Vivaldi are Chromium browsers to name a few.  

Firefox: [TamperMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)  
Chromium: [TamperMonkey](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?pli=1) (May have to [Enable Developer Mode](https://youtu.be/vGxpOBnLzp8))  
Safari: [Userscripts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/userscripts/id1463298887)

## Installation

1. Install [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or another userscript extension.
2. Click on the link and the extension should detect the file and prompt you to install.
